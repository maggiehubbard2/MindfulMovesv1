/**
 * This file is kept for potential future use or external refresh calls.
 * The main refresh logic is now handled directly in useAppRefresh hook
 * to avoid circular dependencies and simplify the architecture.
 * 
 * If you need to trigger a refresh from outside the hook (e.g., manual refresh button),
 * you can import the contexts directly and call their refresh methods.
